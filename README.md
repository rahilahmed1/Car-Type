# Car-Type

generate a a random values for a car type and the questions
- implement a function that classifies a given data point using a ellipsoid classifier 
- What is the classification accuracy when getRange_familyCar_medium() function is used for obtaining the boundaries for family cars and classify_instance_byRectangle() function is used for classifying the instances in the test set.
- Given a set of actual labels (gLabels) and predicted labels (gPredictedLabels), implement a function that returns RMSE
- Calculate $w_0$ and $w_1$ values in linear regression equation $r = w_0+w_1*x$ based on the closed form expressions.
